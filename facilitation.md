# Resources for Group Facilitation

This document collects some resources on group facilitation, meeting design etc. It is a work in progress.

* [Liberating Structures]() is a framework of small structures of interaction designed to break meetings and events out of standard modes of unstructured interaction. A key idea is to be intentional about how people interact in order to allow everyone in the room to contribute. I've used these in a bunch of different circumstances.

* [Theory of Change](https://www.theoryofchange.org) has been suggested to me, but I've not used it yet anywhere.
