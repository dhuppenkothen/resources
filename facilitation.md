# Resources for Group Facilitation

This document collects some resources on group facilitation, meeting design etc. It is a work in progress.

## General Facilitation

* [Liberating Structures]() is a framework of small structures of interaction designed to break meetings and events out of standard modes of unstructured interaction. A key idea is to be intentional about how people interact in order to allow everyone in the room to contribute. I've used these in a bunch of different circumstances.

* [Theory of Change](https://www.theoryofchange.org) has been suggested to me, but I've not used it yet anywhere.

* [Lean Coffee Facilitator's Guide](https://medium.com/agile-outside-the-box/lean-coffee-facilitator-s-guide-d79d9f13d0a9): how to facilitate a Lean Coffee (short meeting without a pre-made agenda)


## Remote/Online Facilitation
* [Resources for Online Meetings, Classes and Events](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NyrEU7n6IUl5rgGiflx_dK8CrdoB2bwyyl9XG-H7iw8/preview#heading=h.92rf1h1b0f3o) from the Facilitators for Pandemic Rsponse group. Very in-depth document for how to support online facilitation.
